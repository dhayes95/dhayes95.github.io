	I am currently a postdoc at the University of Delaware working under Dr. Jingmei Qiu. In 2023, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Delaware under the advisement of Dr. Constantin Bacuta. 
		My Ph.D. research was focused on finite element methods for steady-state parametric problems exhibiting boundary layers.

	I am originally from Western New York, where I attended SUNY Geneseo, a small liberal arts school, and received my B.A. in Mathematics in 2018. Following this, I attended 
		the University of Delaware where I obtained my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2023. Aside from mathematical research and teaching, I enjoy golfing, cooking, trying new foods,
		and spending time with family and friends.
